# Plan 💡

The planning phase of DevOps is often [agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

- • Iterative
- • Continuous
- • Can (and will) change frequently
- • No "big bang" launch, an iterative approach

> For this demo we will be planning the launch of a new chat bot command `.devops`

<style>
blockquote {
  color: #A9A9A9;
}
</style>

# Code 💻

The coding phase of DevOps is where ideas come to life... and where nightmares are born

```python
if production == "down":
  print("This does not bring joy")
```

- 👯 Develop in sharable and automated environments
- 🖌️ Adopt a common code style (use a linter)
- ⚙️ Use a version control system
- 💾 Commit and push often
- 👀 Work in the open, get feedback, request reviews

> For the DevOpsDaysLA demo, we will be writting code in [GitHub codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

<style>
blockquote {
  color: #A9A9A9;
}
</style>

---

# Build 📦

The build phase of DevOps is where the code is compiled and often saved as an artifact for later deployment

- 🛠️ Build your application / binaries in a repeatable environment (CI/CD)
- 🐳 Containerize applications and services where you can
- 🔒 Secure your software supply chain when building applications
- 🔑 Seperate packages, containers, and binaries from configurations and secrets

> For the DevOpsDaysLA demo, we will be using Docker to containerize and build our application

<style>
blockquote {
  color: #A9A9A9;
}
</style>

---

# Test 🧪

The test phase of DevOps is where the application is... tested!

- 👯 Repeatable test environment (CI/CD + Docker)
- 👨‍🔬 Unit tests
- 🌐 Integration tests
- 🔬 Container scanning
- 🔎 SAST & DAST - Code scanning

> For the DevOpsDaysLA demo, you will get exposure to unit tests, container scanning, and static analysis

# What is Errbot? 🤖

[Errbot](https://github.com/GrantBirki/errbot) is an implementation of the [errbotio/errbot](https://github.com/errbotio/errbot) framework.

My version of errbot differs from the original in the following ways:

- • Containerized
- • Comes with pre-built features and chat commands
- • Custom helper functions
- • Altered base plugins and code
- • Custom configuration

> My version of errbot is specifically built around Discord, but many features natively support Slack as well. Check out the upstream source for [errbotio/errbot](https://github.com/errbotio/errbot) to learn more about supported backends, configuration, and bot development

# Pages GitHub Actions Workflow ⏩

![Pages Workflow](assets/pages-workflow.png)

Hooray! We not have all the nitty gritty documentation for our bot publically hosted on GitHub Pages!

---

# Setup

To begin implementing our `.devops` bot command, we need to first start our dev environment:

**DevOpsDaysLA Workshop:**

Simply create a new GitHub Codespace

![GitHub Codespace](assets/codespaces-launch.png)

**Non-DevOpsDaysLA Workshop:**

[Public setup documentation](https://errbot.birki.io/)

---

# Codespaces 💻

If you are apart of the DevOpsDaysLA workshop, you will be able to create a new GitHub Codespace for development

**What is GitHub Codespaces?**

- ☁️ Cloud hosted development environment
- 👯 Consistent, repeatable, and shareable
- 🚧 Removes the "it works on my machine" barrier
- 🔥 Saves us from dependency hell
- ⭐ Allows developers to deploy a dev environement in one-click and begin working on a project

You can read more about GitHub Codespaces [here](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

> Note: If you are not apart of the DevOpsDaysLA workshop, you will **not** have free access to GitHub codespaces and will need to setup errbot [locally for development](https://errbot.birki.io/setup/)

<style>
blockquote {
  color: #A9A9A9;
}
</style>

---

# Connect to Codespace

![Connect to Codespace](assets/codespaces-connect.png)

You will now connect to Codespaces through your browser. If you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed, you can optionally attach there as well.

Our Codespace environment comes pre-installed with all the dependencies we need to run errbot locally and develop new features.

> Note: If you are **not** apart of the DevOpsDaysLA workshop, you will be doing all the following steps from here on locally and not in GitHub Codespaces

<style>
blockquote {
  color: #A9A9A9;

# Generating a Bot Token 🔑

The first step to build our bot locally is to generate a bot token. This workshop uses Discord but you can also use Slack or [other chat services](https://errbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/setup.html#id1) as well.

**Discord:**

- 1: Navigate to the [Discord App Dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- 2: Click the "New Application" button - Name your bot `firstname-errbot-dev`
- 3: Click the "Bot" tab -> "Add Bot"
- 4: Copy down your bot token
- 5: Under the "General Information" tab, copy down your bot's `application id`

![Discord Bot Token Copy](assets/discord-bot-token-copy.png)

---

# Configure the Bot 🔧

For this step, all you need to do is "check the box" for "Server Members Intent":

![Server Members Intent](assets/discord-bot-server-members-intent.png)

---

# Invite the Bot 🔗

The next step is to invite your newly created bot to your Discord server.

Use the `application id` from the previous step to invite your bot to your server and paste it into the link below:

```text
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<application_id>&permissions=36734976&scope=bot
```

Paste the formatted link above link into your browser and add the bot to your desired server!

> For the DevOpsDaysLA workshop you can join the following Discord server for testing and bot invites: [Server Invite Link](https://discord.gg/76q9Ca4RzW)

<style>
blockquote {
  color: #A9A9A9;
}
</style>

---

# Setup Bot Token 🔑

From your codespace (or local) console, execute the following commands:

Create the `secret.yaml` file for your local k8s deployment:

```text
cp script/k8s/errbot/secret.yaml.example script/k8s/errbot/secret.yaml
```

[base64](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#overview-of-secrets) encode your bot token (from the previous slide):

```text
python3 script/base64string.py --string <bot_token>
```

Add your base64 encoded bot token to the `script/k8s/errbot/secret.yaml` file:

`"${CHAT_SERVICE_TOKEN}"` -> `"your-bot-token-here"`

---

# Start the Bot with Skaffold ☸️

We will be using [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) to run our bot for development (either in Codespaces or locally)

Start our [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/), cluster:

> Note: You may need to run `sudo chown -R $USER $HOME/.minikube; chmod -R u+wrx $HOME/.minikube` to start your minikube cluster in Codespaces

```text
minikube start --profile custom

skaffold config set --global local-cluster true

eval $(minikube -p custom docker-env)
```

Run the bot with Skaffold (and tail the logs):

```text
skaffold dev --tail=true
```

<style>
blockquote {
  color: #A9A9A9;
}
</style>

---

# Development Environment 1,000 Foot Overview 🦅

While the Skaffold command is running, let's look at our dev env ([source](https://errbot.birki.io/deployment/)):

![Project Directories](assets/project-directories.png)

---

# Kubernetes Files 📂

The `script/k8s/` directory contains all the files we need to deploy our bot to Kubernetes locally (using Skaffold)

**Benefits of using Skaffold:**

- • Live reload (changes to source files or k8s manifests)
- • Handles all `kubectl` commands for us
- • Faster dev cycles
- • Very close to our production environment (if not identical)

**Alternative dev building options:**

- 🐳 Docker-compose - The `make run` command from the root of this repo is a wrapper command for building locally with Docker-compose
- ☸️ Minikube - The `make kube` command from the root of this repo is a wrapper command for building locally with minikube using `kubectl`
