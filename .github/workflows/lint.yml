            You will need to properly lint your code before CI can pass

            Run the following script to lint your code:

            ```bash
            script/lint
            ```

            Or manually lint the repo:

            ```bash
            pip install black
            black .
            ```

            > If you are running manually, ensure you run the command from the root of the repo

            Commit your changes and try again!
